Dear Oliver,
Repair_OS is starting to become annoying. At multiple points this week, I've tried connecting to the net with no success because your process is binding the network socket.
I have important work to do, can you please keep your process from running 24/7? Thanks.
At this rate, it's going to become a memory leak.
