Dear Customer 2854
Order #0075294-78 has an attatched note from the sales clerk

"As you asked, I didn't dig into this thing at all.
I wish I could be there when you search through this thing's hard drive,
like dude, the original Clearnet Prototype? There has got to be some sick stuff on here.
It inspired Windows 95 right? so it had to do something right.

Well anyways, I ramble a lot. It still has the original floppy drive A installed into it.
Unfortunately, I had to take it out to add these files to it. I know it's stupid but it's company policy.
Otherwise this thing hasn't been touched in almost 2 decades now. I wonder why they ever stopped working on it
Happy hunting!"
